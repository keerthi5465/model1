Model predicting the cost based on the hoursepower
🚀 Excited to share my journey into the world of AI! 🤖 After diving into TensorFlow and Google Colab, I successfully built my first AI model to predict prices based on horsepower using a training dataset. Here's a glimpse into the process:

1️⃣ **Modeling:** Utilized linear regression model to establish relationships between horsepower and price.

2️⃣ **Error Measurement:** Employed RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to assess the accuracy of predictions.

3️⃣ **Training and Optimization:** Leveraged Adam optimization algorithm to fine-tune the model for better performance.

4️⃣ **Performance Measurement:** Rigorously evaluated the model's performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.

5️⃣ **Validation and Testing:** Ensured robustness by validating and testing the model against diverse datasets.

6️⃣ **Correction Measures:** Implemented strategies to handle outliers and biases, including shuffling the data and using three dense layers to enhance model resilience.

Throughout this journey, TensorFlow API and Google Colab proved to be invaluable tools, simplifying the process of model development despite some initial setbacks in output accuracy. Excited to continue learning and refining my skills in machine learning! 💡💪 #MachineLearning #TensorFlow #GoogleColab #AIJourney #DataScience #ModelBuilding
